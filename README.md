# ML4HEP_V3_project

The dataset used is taken from the repository of <a href = "https://github.com/pierinim">Maurizio pierinim</a> for his GGI lecture series.

The dataset contains:
- A set of physics-motivated high-level features 
- Jets represented as an images in the $\Delta\eta-\Delta\phi$ plane
- Kinematic variables for the jets.

Once can use these different types of datasets to tackle different ML problem statements: 
- For a 2D-CNN based classification one can use the jet images
- For a 1D-NN based one can use the 1D Kinematic variables defined for each jet.
